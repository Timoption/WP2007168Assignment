        Three of my strengths are:
        <ul>
            <li>
                I am very creative.
            </li>
            <li>
                I am very hard working.
            </li>
            <li>
                I am good at problem solving.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>In the past five years I have been improving these skills through doing researh on different techniquesto get better at these skills.
        <br>Through these research I have found that regular exercise helps to keep people motivated through the increase of dopamine to the brain.
        <br>Also seeing that I do not have much exercise equipment, I forced to be resourceful and use diifferent objects around the house to exercise.
        <br>Creativity takes practice and over the last five years I have had plenty of opportunities to be creative in school and in personal projects.

                The reason for setting a goal is for what it makes you accomplish. Goal setting is deciding where you want to go and then designing a plan to get you there. Setting goals that stretch you and make you do things differently is what will lead you to the
                future that you want. Don’t wait for people to set goals for you.Everyday has many opportunities, but only one best opportunity. We all must suffer from one of two pains: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret. The difference is
                that discipline weighs ounces and regret weights tons. Your best opportunity each day are those that align with your overall goals and should be what you spend your time on. Don’t just go through the day, get from the day. Don’t spend
                you time on urgent, spend your time on what is important. We must be our own designer of our lives.Don’t join an easy crowd; you wont grow. Go where the expectations and the demands to perform are high. Ask yourself these questions: Who
                am I around? What effect are they having on me? What have they got me reading? What have they got me saying? Where do they have me going? What do they have me thinking? And most importantly, what do they have me becoming? Then ask yourself
                the final question: is that okay? Friends of convenience. This is an interesting concept. Is it easier to keep certain people for friends, instead of pursuing new friends. Successful people look for relationships with other successful
                people who will push them, challenge them, and encourage them to become better. To attract attractive people, you must be attractive. Not physically but mentally and who you are. Your attitude is greatly influenced by the people who you
                associate with.Formal education will make you a living. Self education will make you a fortune. Self-education is what you teach yourself. It is what you learn along the way so that you are constantly improving and growing. Most people
                don’t continue to learn and grow, to separate yourself from everyone else, be focused on continuous learning. Learning is the beginning of wealth. Learning is the beginning of health. Learning is the beginning of spirituality. Searching
                and learning are where the miracle process all begins. Most of life is lived after your formal education. That means the rest of it is up to you. You have to read the books. Books are and will continue to be the best learning tools of
                mankind.
